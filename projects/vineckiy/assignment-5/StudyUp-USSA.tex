\section{The Stories Due Next Week}
\textbf{Ability to create a study group.}

Calvin is the developer who is assigned to this story. He has already started work developing the UI and is beginning work on the functionality. This work can be done in parallel with other stories.

\textbf{See current groups when entering site.}

Moyez is assigned to this story. He has designed the UI elements for the page and is now tasked with making it functional with real data. This functionality depends on canvas login to retrieve class data from page.

\textbf{Login with canvas login.}

Yukon is assigned to this story. This story has been implemented and validated to function properly. This item completed ahead of schedule allowing work on functionality for other stories to be properly tested.

\textbf{Join group easily.}

This story item is apart of viewing a study group which is assigned to Chandler. This involves having a visible button when viewing study groups to join the group. The UI element has already been implemented with the functionality to be completed next.

\section{Meeting Report}
This week the group met on Friday to check in on each group member's progress on implementing the functionality of their portion of the UI. Additionally, we discussed 15 user stories relevant to our application, as well as the corresponding tasks needed to meet the criteria of each user story.

Currently, the functionality the user login is complete. Otherwise, Yukon is working on the database so that way we can integrate in all parts of the UI and get a functioning application. Right now, however, we are all working with sample objects in effort to get each individual UI component functioning. Chandler is working "View", Calvin on "Create Study Group", and Moyez on "Find Study Group." Getting the database running and continuing to implement the functionality will be an ongoing goal for this week as well.

Chandler will work on the "View" functionality, Yukon will continue work on the database, Calvin will work on implementing the "Create Study Group" functionality, and Moyez will work on the "Find Study Group functionality." By next week, our goal is to have a rough functional version of the website.

We met with our customer and discussed the tasks. we found the proposed tasks reasonable and plan on implementing them. We are planning on meeting Tuesday and Friday in order to check in on each group member's progress and continue working on our implementations.
